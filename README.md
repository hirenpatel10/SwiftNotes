# SwiftNotes
Developed a simple iOS app to leverage the Action button on iOS devices for quickly creating, editing, and managing tasks, with a minimalist UI inspired by GitHub Wikis to enhance user experience.

- Implemented features such as note creation, editing, task prioritization, and automatic organization using SwiftData.
- Built a dynamic interface using SwiftUI and NavigationLink for smooth navigation between tasks, calendar views, and detail views.
